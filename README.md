Python.Snowfall
===============

Snowfall simulation for SP2022 Final Project

What we've done: mountain modeling, snow free falling, based on repo https://github.com/adamkdean/Python.Snowfall

TODO: partical simulation with gravity, stickiness, accumulated snow collapse when physics allows, and also possibly 3D simulation w/ NERF
